    <h1>Why I'm becoming a developer</h1>
    <p><strong>Hi, I'm David.</strong></p>
    <p>
      There's been a surge in interest in the IT area in the last few years. What could be the reason for such growth? The high salaries and the possibility of remote work could be some of the reasons. But is that all that being a developer can offer? Here are the reasons <strong>why I'm becoming a developer.</strong>

    <p>
      Technology has always fascinated me. Building stuff with electronics and messing around on my computer were my favorite activities when I was a kid. As I grew older, I learned how computers work by helping friends and family with their problems. Recently I've been interested in <em>machine learning and web development</em>, both of which are in need of skilled professionals.
      Knowing I can work with something I love and change the world while doing it has been exhilarating.

    <h2>Problem-Solving</h2>
    <p>
      I like the rewarding feeling you get when you finish a puzzle after working hard to solve it, and the development process is no different. Being a developer could be thought of as being a <strong> puzzle solver</strong>. How can I make an application that does X? How can I make a website behave a certain way? That's why the problem-solving component of working as a developer is so appealing to me.
    </p>
    <h2>Colaboration</h2>
    <p>
      <em>Collaborating is an integral part of a developer's day</em>. I have always liked group projects because each member can bring a different view to a problem, helping to solve it. GitHub and other tools have made collaboration between developers even easier in recent years. I can't wait to work with other people on meaningful projects.
    </p>
    <h2>Flexibility</h2>
    <p>
      The idea of visiting and maybe even moving to other countries has crossed my mind more than once. The need for developers worldwide and the <strong>rise in popularity of remote work</strong> are more positive attributes of the career.
    </p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      After writing all the reasons down, I'm even more confident that <em>being a developer is the right choice for me</em>. I still have much to learn about being a developer and about myself, but now you know Why I'm becoming a developer.
